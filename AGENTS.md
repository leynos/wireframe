# Assistant Instructions

## Code Style and Structure

* **Code is for humans.** Write your code with clarity and empathy—assume a tired teammate will need to debug it at 3 a.m.
* **Comment *why*, not *what*.** Explain assumptions, edge cases, trade-offs, or complexity. Don't echo the obvious.
* **Clarity over cleverness.** Be concise, but favour explicit over terse or obscure idioms. Prefer code that's easy to follow.
* **Use functions and composition.** Avoid repetition by extracting reusable logic. Prefer generators or comprehensions, and declarative code to imperative repetition when readable.
* **Small, meaningful functions.** Functions must be small, clear in purpose, single responsibility, and obey command/query segregation.
* **Clear commit messages.** Commit messages should be descriptive, explaining what was changed and why.
* **Name things precisely.** Use clear, descriptive variable and function names. For booleans, prefer names with `is`, `has`, or `should`.
* **Structure logically.** Each file should encapsulate a coherent module. Group related code (e.g., models + utilities + fixtures) close together.
* **Group by feature, not layer.** Colocate views, logic, fixtures, and helpers related to a domain concept rather than splitting by type.

## Documentation Maintenance

* **Reference:** Use the markdown files within the `docs/` directory as a knowledge base and source of truth for project requirements, dependency choices, and architectural decisions.
* **Update:** When new decisions are made, requirements change, libraries are added/removed, or architectural patterns evolve, **proactively update** the relevant file(s) in the `docs/` directory to reflect the latest state. Ensure the documentation remains accurate and current.

## Change Quality & Committing

* **Atomicity:** Aim for small, focused, atomic changes. Each change (and subsequent commit) should represent a single logical unit of work.
* **Quality Gates:** Before considering a change complete or proposing a commit, ensure it meets the following criteria:
    * Passes all relevant unit and behavioral tests according to the guidelines above.
    * Passes lint checks
    * Adheres to formatting standards tested using a formatting validator.
* **Committing:**
  * Only changes that meet all the quality gates above should be committed.
  * Write clear, descriptive commit messages summarizing the change, following these formatting guidelines:
    * **Imperative Mood:** Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug", "Add feature" instead of "Fixed bug", "Added feature").
    * **Subject Line:** The first line should be a concise summary of the change (ideally 50 characters or less).
    * **Body:** Separate the subject from the body with a blank line. Subsequent lines should explain the *what* and *why* of the change in more detail, including rationale, goals, and scope. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
    * **Formatting:** Use Markdown for any formatted text (like bullet points or code snippets) within the commit message body.
  * Do not commit changes that fail any of the quality gates.

## Refactoring Heuristics & Workflow

* **Recognizing Refactoring Needs:** Regularly assess the codebase for potential refactoring opportunities. Consider refactoring when you observe:
  * **Long Methods/Functions:** Functions or methods that are excessively long or try to do too many things.
  * **Duplicated Code:** Identical or very similar code blocks appearing in multiple places.
  * **Complex Conditionals:** Deeply nested or overly complex `if`/`else` or `switch` statements (high cyclomatic complexity).
  * **Large Code Blocks for Single Values:** Significant chunks of logic dedicated solely to calculating or deriving a single value.
  * **Primitive Obsession / Data Clumps:** Groups of simple variables (strings, numbers, booleans) that are frequently passed around together, often indicating a missing class or object structure.
  * **Excessive Parameters:** Functions or methods requiring a very long list of parameters.
  * **Feature Envy:** Methods that seem more interested in the data of another class/object than their own.
  * **Shotgun Surgery:** A single change requiring small modifications in many different classes or functions.
* **Post-Commit Review:** After committing a functional change or bug fix (that meets all quality gates), review the changed code and surrounding areas using the heuristics above.
* **Separate Atomic Refactors:** If refactoring is deemed necessary:
  * Perform the refactoring as a **separate, atomic commit** *after* the functional change commit.
  * Ensure the refactoring adheres to the testing guidelines (behavioral tests pass before and after, unit tests added for new units).
  * Ensure the refactoring commit itself passes all quality gates.

## Rust Specific Guidance
This repository is written in Rust and uses Cargo for building and dependency management. Contributors should follow these best practices when working on the project:

* Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` before committing.
* Clippy warnings MUST be disallowed.
* Where a function is too long, extract meaningfully named helper functions adhering to separation of concerns and CQRS.
* Where a function has too many parameters, group related parameters in meaningfully named structs.
* Where a function is returning a large error consider using `Arc` to reduce the amount of data returned.
* Write unit and behavioural tests for new functionality. Run both before and after making any change.
* Document public APIs using Rustdoc comments (`///`) so documentation can be generated with cargo doc.
* Prefer immutable data and avoid unnecessary `mut` bindings.
* Handle errors with the `Result` type instead of panicking where feasible.
* Use explicit version ranges in `Cargo.toml` and keep dependencies up-to-date.
* Avoid `unsafe` code unless absolutely necessary and document any usage clearly.

## Markdown Guidance

* Validate Markdown files using `markdownlint`.
* Validate Markdown Mermaid diagrams using `nixie`.

**These practices will help maintain a high-quality codebase and make collaboration easier**
