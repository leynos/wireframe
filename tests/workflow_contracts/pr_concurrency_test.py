"""Every pull-request-startable workflow cancels superseded runs.

Pushing twice to a pull request in quick succession leaves the first
run charging minutes for a result nobody will read. GitHub cancels it
only when the workflow declares a concurrency group keyed on the pull
request and sets ``cancel-in-progress``.

The sweep below reads the repository's own workflows. The cases after
it drive the readers directly with synthetic documents, because a rule
parametrized over files that already conform passes whether or not it
discriminates: the synthetic cases are what prove it rejects a missing
line, a literal ``true`` that would cancel a push to main, and a group
keyed on the run identifier that serializes nothing.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
