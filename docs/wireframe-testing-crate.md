# `wireframe_testing`: Testing Helpers for Wireframe

`wireframe_testing` is a proposed companion crate providing utilities for unit
and integration tests. It focuses on driving `WireframeApp` instances with raw
frames, enabling fast tests without opening real network connections.

## Motivation

The existing tests in [`tests/`](../tests) use a helper function called
`run_app` to feed length-prefixed frames through an in-memory duplex stream.
This helper simplifies testing handlers by allowing assertions on encoded
responses without spinning up a full server. Encapsulating this logic in a
dedicated crate keeps test code concise and reusable across projects.

## Crate Layout

- `wireframe_testing`
  - `Cargo.toml` enabling the `tokio` and `rstest` dependencies used by the
    helpers.
  - `src/lib.rs` exposing asynchronous functions for driving apps with raw

```frames.
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt"] }

[dev-dependencies]
rstest = "0.18"
```

```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub mod helpers;

pub use helpers::{
    drive_with_frame,
    drive_with_frames,
    drive_with_frame_with_capacity,
    drive_with_frames_with_capacity,
    drive_with_bincode,
};
```

The crate would live in a `wireframe_testing/` directory alongside the main
`wireframe` crate.

## Proposed API

```rust
use tokio::io::Result as IoResult;
use wireframe::app::WireframeApp;
use serde::Serialize;

/// Feed a single frame into `app` using an in-memory duplex stream.
pub async fn drive_with_frame(app: WireframeApp, frame: Vec<u8>) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>;

/// Drive `app` with multiple frames, returning all bytes written by the app.
pub async fn drive_with_frames(app: WireframeApp, frames: Vec<Vec<u8>>) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>;

/// Encode `msg` with `bincode`, wrap it in a frame, and drive the app.
pub async fn drive_with_bincode<M>(app: WireframeApp, msg: M) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>
where
    M: Serialize;
```

These functions mirror the behaviour of the `run_app` helper found in the
repositoryâ€™s test utilities. They create a `tokio::io::duplex` stream, spawn
the application as a background task, and write the provided frame(s) to the
client side of the stream. After the application finishes processing, the
helpers collect the bytes written back and return them for inspection.

Any I/O errors surfaced by the duplex stream or failures while decoding a
length prefix propagate through the returned `IoResult`. Malformed or truncated
frames therefore cause the future to resolve with an error, allowing tests to
assert on these failure conditions directly.

### Custom Buffer Capacity

A variant accepting a buffer `capacity` allows fine-tuning the size of the
in-memory duplex channel. The legacy helpers `run_app_with_frame_with_capacity`
and `run_app_with_frames_with_capacity` are replaced by `run_app`, which
accepts `Option<usize>` for the buffer size.

```helpers.
pub async fn drive_with_frame_with_capacity(
    app: WireframeApp,
    frame: Vec<u8>,
    capacity: usize,
) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>;

pub async fn drive_with_frames_with_capacity(
    app: WireframeApp,
    frames: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    capacity: usize,
) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>;

/// The above helpers consume the `WireframeApp`. For scenarios
/// where a single app instance should be reused across calls,
/// borrow it mutably instead.
pub async fn drive_with_frame_mut(app: &mut WireframeApp, frame: Vec<u8>) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>;
pub async fn drive_with_frames_mut(app: &mut WireframeApp, frames: Vec<Vec<u8>>) -> IoResult<Vec<u8>>;
```

### Bincode Convenience Wrapper

For most tests the input frame is preassembled from raw bytes. A small wrapper
can accept any `serde::Serialize` value and perform the encoding and framing
before delegating to `drive_with_frame`. The approach mirrors patterns in
`tests/routes.rs`, where structs convert to bytes with `BincodeSerializer`
before being wrapped in a length-prefixed frame.

```rust
#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
struct Ping(u8);

let bytes = drive_with_bincode(app, Ping(1)).await.unwrap();
assert_eq!(bytes, [0, 1]);
```

## Example Usage

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use wireframe_testing::{drive_with_frame, drive_with_frames};
use wireframe::processor::LengthPrefixedProcessor;
use crate::tests::{build_test_frame, expected_bytes};

#[tokio::test]
async fn handler_echoes_message() {
    let app = WireframeApp::new()
        .unwrap()
        .frame_processor(LengthPrefixedProcessor::default())
        .route(1, Arc::new(|_| Box::pin(async {})))
        .unwrap();

    let frame = build_test_frame();
    let out = drive_with_frame(app, frame).await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(out, expected_bytes());
}
```

This pattern mirrors the style of `tests/routes.rs`, where handlers are invoked
with prebuilt frames and their responses decoded for assertions.

## Benefits

- **Isolation**: Handlers can be tested without spinning up a full server or
  opening sockets.
- **Reusability**: Projects consuming `wireframe` can depend on
  `wireframe_testing` in their dev-dependencies to leverage the same helpers.
- **Clarity**: Abstracting the duplex stream logic keeps test cases focused on
  behaviour instead of transport details.

### Capturing Logs in Tests

The `wireframe_testing` crate exposes a [`LoggerHandle`] fixture for asserting
log output. Acquire it in a test and call `clear()` to discard any records from
fixture setup. Records can then be inspected using `pop()`:

```rust
use wireframe_testing::logger;

#[tokio::test]
async fn captures_logs() {
    let mut logs = logger();
    logs.clear();
    log::error!(target = "demo", key = 1, "boom");
    let record = logs.pop().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(record.target(), "demo");
}
```

## Next Steps

Implement the crate in a new directory, export the helper functions, and
migrate existing tests to use them. Additional fixtures (e.g., prebuilt frame
processors) can be added over time as test coverage grows.
